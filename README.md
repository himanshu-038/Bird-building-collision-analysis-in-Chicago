**Analysis of bird-building collisions in Chicago with respect to night time lighting over 16 years (2000- 2016)**

**Aims of this analysis:**
1) Import the CSVs for the Chicago bird-building collision data and the light level data for McCormack Place. Get a feel for the data and check for missing values.
2) Find out statistics about the bird-building collisions in with respect to the years and perform linear regression on number of collisions VS the year
3) Compare the number of collisions with respect to the locality (MP or CH)
4) Find out how the collision count vary with the light levels in McCormack Place (MP)
5) Analyse and visualize the relationship between the year, number of collisions and lightscores in McCormack Place
